# CF-YOLO
# YOLOV11s-Enhanced

This project builds upon YOLOV11s with enhancements aimed at improving the model's accuracy and efficiency in small object detection.
The repository will provide model code, training and testing scripts, along with detailed introductions to the innovations.

Innovations
SBAM (Split-Block Attention Module): Leverages a self-attention-guided split strategy to integrate global and local contextual information.

CMFF (Cross-layer Multi-scale Feature Fusion Module): Introduces cross-layer multi-scale feature interactions atop the pyramid network, significantly boosting localization and classification performance for small objects.

MBD (Multi-Branch Downsampling Module): Employs multi-branch downsampling techniques to preserve high-information-density shallow features.

Open-Source Statement
This project will be open-sourced after the formal acceptance of the associated paper. Thank you for your attention and support!
